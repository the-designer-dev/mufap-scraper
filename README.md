# Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan - Performance Summary Scraper
This is a python based web scraper that takes data from MUFAP's Performance Summary and outputs four separate CSV files. Namely;
- Open End Schemes 
- Dedicated Equity Funds 
- Voluntary Pension Funds 
- Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)
<br>
This code was written to assist Fund Managers, Product Managers, Developers and Investors in making quick decisions with regards to Mutual Funds performance. This repository is the first step in extracting fast changing information reliably from the regulators website. 

# Potential Use Cases
Something we already built for our clients was an easy to use dashboard which can take in these inputs and display them with visually appealing graphs, charts and other data representation forms. The dashboard also provided an easy to use fund comparison tool and a NAV history for each of the funds.
